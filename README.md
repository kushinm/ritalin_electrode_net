# ritalin_electrode_net

Code and materials for electrode analysis of effects of Ritalin on dorsal medial PFC and Striatum

## Data

Download the electrode data from : https://uwmadison.box.com/s/cnof562um9q1lf7f8n6kpcmj40ep0u9k  

Place the files in the `/data` directory

## Analysis TODOs: 

### Single Electrode Analysis:
- [ ] Tune elastic net parameter and see its effect on cross validated accuracy
- [ ] Plot model coefficients from our best models for each rat 

### Multiple Electrode Analysis
- [ ] Tune elastic net parameter and see its effect on cross validated accuracy
- [ ] Plot model coefficients from our best models for each rat 
- [ ] For each rat fit models for 'time windows' for each electrode and repeat the above two steps.
- [ ] Fold in dmSTR data

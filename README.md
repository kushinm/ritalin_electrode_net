# ritalin_electrode_net

Code and materials for electrode analysis of effects of Ritalin on dorsal medial PFC and Striatum

## Analysis TODOs: 

### Single Electrode Analysis:
- [] Tune elastic net parameter and see its effect on cross validated accuracy
- [] Plot model coefficients from our best models for each rat 

### Multiple Electrode Analysis
- [] Tune elastic net parameter and see its effect on cross validated accuracy
- [] Plot model coefficients from our best models for each rat 
- [] For each rat fit models for 'time windows' for each electrode and repeat the above two steps.
- [] Fold in dmSTR data
